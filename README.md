Aurelia NitrogenLabs Skeleton

This skeleton is based on the [Aurelia skeleton](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation). For those of you who would like to use Bower for javascript management instead of JSPM. It also demonstrates the use of a file structure. More details on the platform can be found on the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) website.

## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. Ensure that [bower](http://bower.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g bower
  ```
5. Install the client-side dependencies with bower:

  ```shell
  bower install
  ```
6. To run the app, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  gulp
  ```
7. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.
